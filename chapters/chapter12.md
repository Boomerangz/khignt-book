Глава 12. Перекрёсток

The mountain pass behind them fell away into mist as Tim, Thomas, and Bran crested the final ridge. Before them stretched a valley unlike anything Tim had ever seen during his years in the south—a vast expanse of heather-covered moorland, dotted with ancient standing stones and crossed by silver streams. Low stone cottages with thatched roofs clustered around a central clearing, smoke rising from chimneys in thin, straight columns that seemed to pierce the low-hanging clouds.

"Home smells the same," Tim said quietly, breathing in the scent of peat smoke, damp earth, and heather. The dragon's blood metal of his repaired helmet hummed faintly against his fingertips, responding to the land around them.

The trio descended toward the settlement, following a path marked by cairns—carefully balanced stone piles that Tim remembered helping to maintain as a child. Bran walked with unusual tension in his shoulders.

"Something troubles you?" Tim asked.

"This place recognizes what I am," Bran replied, sniffing the air. "The curse feels... different here. More like a mantle than a burden."

As they approached the outskirts, they passed through a circle of standing stones. Each was weathered by centuries of driving rain and wind, etched with spiral patterns and ancient Pictish symbols that Tim recognized from his childhood.

"The stones of Caer Donn," he said, placing his palm against the tallest monolith. "My clan's ancestors raised these before written memory."

Thomas observed with interest. "Your clan?"

"MacFiach," Tim replied. "Though southern tongues struggled with it, so my father used the simpler form when we moved." He traced a weathered wolf symbol carved into the stone. "Each northern clan has its totem and territory, marked by stone circles like these."

Beyond the stones, the village proper revealed itself—sturdy cottages of gray stone with thick walls and small windows built to withstand the harsh winters. The larger buildings had been constructed partially underground, with earthen roofs sprouting heather and wildflowers. At the village center stood a circular stone hall with a conical roof, smoke escaping through a central opening.

The villagers emerged as word of strangers spread. Men wore simple woolen kilts in muted greens and blues, crossed with plaid patterns that identified their clan loyalties. Many wore their hair long, beards braided with silver and iron beads. The women wore practical dresses layered with wool shawls dyed with natural pigments, hair braided and pinned with carved bone ornaments.

An elderly woman approached first, leaning on a blackthorn staff topped with a polished amber stone. Behind her walked a young man carrying a wooden quaich—a two-handled drinking bowl filled with clear liquid.

"You come from beyond the moors," she stated, studying them with keen eyes. "But one returns to his hearth." Her gaze settled on Tim with a flash of recognition. "A son of Clan MacFiach, by the look of you. Your father was Callum's boy, wasn't he?"

Tim nodded, surprised to be remembered after so many years. "Aye, I'm his son."

The woman gestured to the young man, who stepped forward offering the quaich. "Then drink and be welcome, for blood returns to blood."

Tim took the ceremonial bowl and sipped the clear liquid—uisge beatha, the water of life, strong and peaty. He passed it to Thomas, who followed his example, and then to Bran, completing the ritual.

The woman nodded with approval. "I am Moira, keeper of this village's stories. And you, young MacFiach?"

"Tim," he replied, then corrected himself, slipping into the accent of his childhood. "Timmor MacFiach."

Thomas looked at Tim with new understanding, hearing this fuller version of his name for the first time.

"And your companions?" Moira asked.

"Thomas of the Southern Marches," Tim introduced, "and Bran of the Deep Woods, who walks between forms."

Moira studied Bran with particular interest. "The old magic still touches some, I see." She turned back to Tim. "You've come at a complicated time, young MacFiach. The Order of the Serpent visits tomorrow for the spring tithe."

Before Tim could inquire further, the hollow sound of a carved wooden horn echoed across the moor. The villagers turned toward the path leading to the village.

A procession approached from the east. Men and women in deep crimson robes walked with measured steps. Their garments were richly embroidered with golden thread depicting a flame encircled by celestial bodies. They carried banners bearing the same symbol, flapping in the stiff breeze.

Their leader, a tall figure with silver at his temples and an air of austere dignity, walked ahead of the group. He carried an ornate staff topped with a crystal that pulsed with a soft red glow. At his side hung a ceremonial dirk with an elaborate pommel.

The villagers' expressions shifted to careful neutrality. Moira straightened her posture, her face showing the practiced diplomacy of one who has navigated difficult political waters for decades.

"They're early," she muttered. "The Order never visits until the equinox."

The red-robed leader raised his hands in benediction. "Children of the North," he intoned in a rich, resonant voice that carried across the gathering. "The Covenant of the Eternal Flame brings greetings and blessings."

Several villagers bowed their heads. Others remained expressionless.

"The Season of Renewal approaches," the Order's leader continued. "The Eternal Flame, Guardian of Ancient Wisdom, seeks offerings to maintain harmony between our realm and the higher domains." His smile was practiced and did not reach his eyes. "Which clans will demonstrate their fidelity through sacrifice?"

Moira stepped forward. "Clan Donn has prepared the traditional tribute, Brother Malachy." She gestured toward several woven baskets that villagers now brought forward—smoked meats, woolen cloth, metalwork, and small carved tokens representing larger livestock to be collected later.

Malachy inspected the offerings with a discerning eye. "Your loyalty honors the Covenant," he said, though his tone suggested the minimum had been met, not exceeded.

The cultist examined the offerings with a discerning eye. "Your devotion pleases the Serpent," he said, though his tone suggested the minimum had been met, not exceeded. His gaze swept across the gathering and paused when he noticed Tim and his companions.

"Visitors?" His voice sharpened slightly. "Or returning kin?"

"A son of Clan MacFiach," Moira replied carefully. "And his companions seeking temporary shelter."

Malachy approached, studying Tim with particular interest. "MacFiach... Your clan has been absent from our gatherings for many seasons." His eyes narrowed. "Your father traveled south, did he not? Took southern ideas with him?"

Tim met his gaze steadily. "I've come to pay respects to my ancestors' land."

"The south has forgotten the old wisdom," Malachy said, circling Tim slowly. "They chase metal contraptions and smoke-belching machines, while we preserve what truly matters." He leaned closer. "Have you come to remember what your father chose to forget, young MacFiach?"

Thomas tensed beside Tim, but Tim gave a subtle signal to remain calm.

"I follow my own path," Tim answered evenly.

Malachy's smile tightened. "All paths in the north lead to the Eternal Flame—whether in reverence or in judgment." He straightened and addressed the village again. "The faithful clans prosper under the Covenant's protection. The straying find only hardship." His tone remained courteous, but the threat beneath was unmistakable.

As the Order members collected the offerings, a younger acolyte moved among the children, distributing small carved tokens shaped like flames and speaking of loyalty to clan and Covenant. Another sang traditional ballads, but Tim noticed how the lyrics subtly differed from those he remembered—tales of heroes now emphasized submission to greater powers rather than individual courage.

"They've become more sophisticated," Tim murmured to Thomas as they watched. "When I was a child, they were just another clan, albeit a powerful one. Now they speak with the authority of religion."

"Makes them more dangerous," Thomas replied quietly. "Especially when they wrap ambition in tradition."

The village elder turned back to them after the cultists departed, her eyes revealing a complex mixture of resignation and quiet defiance.

"You asked for shelter," she said. "Know that all shelter in the north exists in the shadow of the Serpent's faith." She gestured to a low building near the sacred circle. "You may rest there, but understand that neutrality is not an option they recognize for long."

As the cultists' procession disappeared into the forest, Tim noticed something subtle—when the villagers had handed over their offerings, many had performed a small gesture, fingers forming intricate patterns at their sides. And with each gesture, the elder's staff-flame flickered in response, as if in silent communication.

"They give what is demanded," Tim whispered to Thomas, "but keep what truly matters."

"And what's that?" Thomas asked.

"Their true beliefs," Tim replied. "The old ways endure beneath the surface."

Thomas leaned closer to the flames, entranced by the melody. "What tale do they share?" he asked quietly.

Tim listened, the familiar cadences washing over him. He'd heard variations of this song since childhood, in winter gatherings around the village fire.

"The First Dragon," Tim replied matter-of-factly. "Not the beast we hunt, but the one who existed before time was measured. The song says all dragons we know are but echoes of that original power." He absently tapped his fingers in rhythm with the music. "They're singing of when dragons and humans shared a common tongue, before what we call the Breaking."

Thomas looked at him with interest. "Your father shared these tales?"

"My grandmother mostly," Tim said, a touch of homesickness in his voice. "These are the lullabies northern children fall asleep to. I probably heard this one hundreds of times."

As the music continued, Tim felt his connection to the fire growing stronger. The flames seemed to reach toward him, curious and alive. In their dancing light, the north no longer seemed foreign—it felt like something long forgotten but finally recognized.

"We should have helped them against the cult," Tim said, staring into the flames.

"Sometimes resistance takes forms you don't yet understand," Bran replied, his eyes reflecting the firelight with animal intensity. "Not all battles are fought with swords and fire."

Thomas nodded gravely. "Watch and learn. The north keeps its secrets well. By morning, you'll better understand what we face—and why your father's quest was both simpler and far more complex than you imagined."
