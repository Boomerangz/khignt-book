PROLOGUE – The Monk and the Prophecy Monastic Scriptorium A Monk in a northern monastery updates his tome of prophecies. A cult scout reports that the famous knight (Tim’s father) has been killed by the dragon. The Monk, saddened, nearly crosses out the prophecy. He rereads its vague wording and decides to leave it unaltered. He secretly despises the dragon and suspects the cult is behind its rise. This scene establishes the prophecy’s uncertain future and the Monk’s cautious hope. 

Between prolog and chapter 1.

Tim, son of fallen Knight, steals father's sword and helmet. He was evacuated to South, to his grandma. He feels that he has to fulfil the prophecy now, so he escapes and goes to north.

CHAPTER 1 – Tim on the Road North
Tim (15-16) travels north, carrying his father's damaged helmet and sword - the only pieces of his father's equipment he kept, leaving the rest with his grandmother. The helmet bears deep dents and is made of strange northern metal that southern smiths can't repair.

CHAPTER 2 – Meeting Lucine, the Former Fire Mage

Rainy Encounter
A week after the bandit incident, Tim and Thomas meet Lucine at their evening camp - a tall woman with short light hair and cat-like grace. She reveals herself as a former fire mage journeying south, away from the mountains.

Spark Lesson
Tim struggles with wet firewood. Lucine demonstrates precise fire control, teaching him that power requires restraint. She guides him to create his first spark, emphasizing the importance of treating fire as something alive rather than a tool.

Dark Warning
During a late-night conversation, Lucine reveals her past experiments with strange crystals - dark blue with red veins - that enhanced fire magic but corrupted their users. She warns Tim about the seductive nature of power, hinting at a friend who became consumed by it. Tim has a prophetic dream linking his father's final battle to the nature of fire control.

Parting Message
Lucine departs at dawn, leaving Tim with final lessons in spark control and a warning about the true cost of seeking power. Thomas expresses suspicion about unaffiliated mages, but shows grudging respect when Tim successfully lights the evening's campfire using his new skill.

Chapter 5.1
 The barbarians are repelled, boosting the village’s confidence and showing Thomas’s leadership in defensive tactics. Parting Conflict As winter ends, Tim learns more northern villages are under dragon threat. He plans to leave soon with Thomas and the Bear. Kara pleads with Tim to stay—she fears he’ll die chasing a prophecy. They argue. Tim departs abruptly, leaving a small southern-inspired trinket for her. Unbeknownst to Tim, Kara stays up late and repairs his father’s helmet, revealing her rare skill. 

CHAPTER 6 – First Northern Village Burns On the Road Again Tim, Thomas (health improved but not fully peak), and the Bear cross the now-thawing pass, heading deeper north. Tim discovers Kara’s repaired helmet in his pack—her silent gift. He’s touched but must keep moving. Village Under Cult Threat They reach a small northern village. Cult enforcers demand tribute for the dragon. The villagers beg for help, but Thomas, wary of a direct fight, advises them paying themself. Tim disagrees, but they leave anyway. Consequences Days later, they see smoke from the village’s direction. It’s been burned. Thomas regrets not acting sooner, vowing to protect the next settlement. 


CHAPTER 7 – Second Northern Village & Hiding Strategy Better-Fortified Settlement Arriving at a larger village, Thomas insists on hiding people in cellars, drawing on lessons from the barbarian attack. They trust him more than the previous village. Cult Summoning Attempt A group of younger cultists tries to subjugate the dragon using a crystal. It fails. The dragon arrives, infuriated, torching the village. Thanks to Thomas’s plan, many survive in hidden cellars. The dragon snatches the crystal and leaves. Clue About the Monastery A dying cultist reveals that numerous crystals are hidden in a monastery. The cult uses them to lure and partially manipulate the dragon. 

CHAPTER 8 – Monastery Heist & Firestorm Failure Lucine’s Warning Revisited Tim recalls Lucine mentioning crystals that never worked as intended. He suspects this is how the dragon was awakened or harnessed. Infiltration Thomas leads the trio (with the Bear’s brute force and Tim’s forging-based lockpicking) into the monastery. They find a stash of magical crystals. Tim, thinking the crystals might bolster his fire magic, seizes them. Dragon’s Ambush The dragon arrives, sensing concentrated crystal power. Tim, supercharged by crystals, unleashes huge firestorms—impressive but futile against the dragon’s impervious scales. The dragon knocks them aside, grabs all the crystals, and flies off, leaving Thomas and the Bear wounded again, Tim devastated. 
CHAPTER 9 – Final Mine Confrontation (Gas Explosion) Desperate Plan Tim, recalling Kara’s lessons about flammable gas pockets in mines, realizes direct fire is pointless. He must use cunning instead. Thomas and the Bear, injured, can’t fight anymore. Tim, more determined than ever, goes alone to the dragon’s lair—an abandoned mine riddled with gas pockets. Mine Chase The dragon, filled with crystal power, ridicules Tim’s “prophecy.” Tim baits it deeper into the mine tunnels, destabilizing wooden supports, allowing flammable gas to accumulate. Ignition Tim ignites the gas with a precisely controlled fireball (combining Lucine’s spark lessons and his winter training). The explosion causes a massive cave-in, burying the dragon. Tim narrowly escapes, protected partly by Kara’s repaired helmet from falling debris. Climactic Victory The dragon, presumably dead or trapped. Tim emerges to daylight, physically and emotionally spent, yet triumphant. EPILOGUE – Monk’s Resolution & Future Threat Monk’s Reaction Back at the monastery’s scriptorium, the Monk hears whispers that the dragon has been defeated. He revisits the prophecy and leaves it intact, concluding it was fulfilled, albeit unconventionally. Cult’s Next Move The Sage or remaining cultists begin excavating the mine in search of crystals (and possibly the dragon’s remains). Their power play continues, hinting at future conflict. Tim’s Reflection Tim reunites with Thomas and the Bear. He contemplates returning south to reconcile with his grandmother, or going back to the mountain village to see Kara. The repaired helmet symbolizes his father’s legacy, Kara’s skill, and his own journey from naive boy to self-made hero.
